Installing with pip


We recommend using pip to install pymongo on all platforms:


$ python -m pip install pymongo

To get a specific version of pymongo:


$ python -m pip install pymongo==3.5.1

To upgrade using pip:


$ python -m pip install --upgrade pymongo

Note pip does not support installing python packages in .egg format. If you would like to install PyMongo from a .egg provided on pypi use easy_install instead.


Installing with easy_install

To use easy_install from setuptools do:


$ python -m easy_install pymongo

To upgrade do:


$ python -m easy_install -U pymongo
